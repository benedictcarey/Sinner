# Sinner
A very greedy little Max for Live additive synth
so many bugs...

Voices not muting after use (leads to ridiculous CPU usage)
Presets not saving properly (needs to recall filter and multislider presets)
Vibrato rate causes issues when set too low (under 40 ms) 
Vibrato should really increase and get faster not the other way round
Max presets don't save with ableton file

Features missing - no lfo for automating parameters, would be nice
would be good to be able to set polyphony, glide
velocity not implemented (maybe...)
